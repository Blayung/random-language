# Random Language Mod

## What is this mod?
This minecraft fabric mod allows you to randomize your game's language with just a single press of a key. You can also always return to your native language by pressing an another key.

## Configuration
You can configure that mod by editing the `.minecraft/config/random-language-mod.json` file, that is generated automatically after you launch the game with the mod for the first time.  
  
It is recommended to delete the config file each update, since its syntax might change and this mod doesn't have a data-fixer-upper.  
**Known versions that WILL break the game if you don't delete the config:**  
- 1.2.0
